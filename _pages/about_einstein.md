Robotics Expert with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (specializing in Robotics) from Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea. My expertise spans motion planning, control systems, and integration for legged robots, autonomous vehicles, and multi-robot coordination in industrial environments.

Currently, I lead core robotics products at Next Robotics as Technical Lead, including the development of Vietnamâ€™s first fleet management system for autonomous mobile robots, deployed in large-scale logistics operations. I also head the AutoMa Lab and lead academic programs and applied research at Nguyen Tat Thanh University and the University of Greenwich (Vietnam), facilitating bilingual instruction, research supervision, and curriculum development in Robotics and AI.

I previously led and contributed to robotics initiatives in Japan and Vietnam, focusing on industrial automation, warehouse robotics, and autonomous driving technologies in real-world deployments.

My research on quadruped locomotion and autonomous systems is ongoing, with recent publications in IROS, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics and Intelligent Service Robotics
