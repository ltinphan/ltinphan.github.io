In this research, the effect of whole body compliance on the quadruped running was investigated and the principles of design & control of the whole body was implemented. 

The robot with 10 DOF acticulated by Series Elastic Actuators (SEA), 2 DOF legs, 2 DOF body with a spinal joint in the middle. The location of the spinal joint in the body was also studied based on energy and performance criteria.{% cite phan2020study % & % cite phan2017stable %}.

The robot used EtherCAT as the real-time communication protocol and was able to run at 4 km/h.
