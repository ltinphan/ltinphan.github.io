Development of trajectory planning for mobile robot to avoid obstalces smoothly using Model Predictive Control 

---


In this work, an autonomous mobile robot was model as the figure below. 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/mpc_vehicle.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

Then, the Model Predictive Control algorithm was built in MATLAB/C++/Python to help the vehicle avoid the obstalce smoothly.
