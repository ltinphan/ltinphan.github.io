Development of the Vietnam's first Auto Parking feature for autonomous driving vehicles
---

As a Solution Architect, I contributed in designing the system architect and developing the algorithms for the motion planning and control module for smooth maneuvering paths to the parking slot detected by a 360degree camera system. The car is able to localize itself using cameras and avoid collisions using radar sensors installed around the vehicles.

The Auto Parking feature supports multiple types of parking slots from Perpendicular, Parallel to Angle slots.
