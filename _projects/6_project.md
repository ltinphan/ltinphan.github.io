Development of the Vietnam's first AMR for warehouses and manufacturing zones
---

As a Solution Architect, I contributed in designing the system architect and developing the algorithms for the motion planning and control module of the AMR for smooth maneuvering motion and safety feature.

NextAMR is a brand of AMR Robot designed & provided by FPT, suitable for many transportation problems in production & logistics.
The NextAMR robot series focuses on the low- and mid-payload segment with a maximum load of up to 1000 kg and can be combined with many different top modules, serving the specific task requirements of customers.
Unlike conventional AGVs, NextAMR can operate without dedicated rails, maneuvering skillfully in environments with people and other obstacles.
